     * fragmentation control commands, however one command 'DATA_FRAGMENT' stands out

     * doesn't have a response that needs to be sent back to network. All other commands
     * will have a response which needs to be transmitted to the network.
     *
     * The application must check 'type' of the response to correctly interpret the
     * correct nature of the fragment control response.
     *
     * @param payload    A pointer to the payload buffer containing fragment control commands
     * @param size       Size of the payload buffer
     * @param msg_type   Fragment control commands can be sent as either Unicast or Multicast or both.
     *                   'msg_type' let's the plug-in know what type of message was it.
     *                   It's synonymous to the 'flags' received using receive() API type-2.
     * @param dev_addr   Device address used in the downlink. Application can retrieve RX metadata
     *                   from the stack to dig the device address.
     * @param opts_cb    A callback function which will be used to ask the application to provide
     *                   resources, e.g., a block device and fragmentation assembler for the purpose
     *                   of storing and forward error correction of the data fragments. The plug-in
     *                   will tell the application the about the 'desc' (an application specific descriptor)
     *                   and the  'frag_index' (identifier of the fragmentation session) received from the application
     *                   server. The application in turn responds by providing the plug-in with 'frag_bd_opts_t' which
     *                   contains pointers to fragment assembler, a block device and various configuration parameters.
     * @param mcast_register
     *                   A pointer to Multicast register maintained by the stack (non-modifiable)
     * @param expected_descriptor
     *                   By default the 'expected_descriptor' is set to 0 which means that the plug-in will accept all
     *                   incoming descriptors. However, the application may choose to stick to a specific descriptor by
     *                   setting a 4 byte long descriptor. In this case if the incoming descriptor doesn't match the
     *                   expected one, an error is returned to the network.
     *
     * @return A pointer to 'frag_ctrl_response_t'. The ownership is not transferred and the application should take a copy of
     *         response in the cases when a reception is expected any time soon, e.g., Class C.

     *         If the response 'type' = FRAG_SESSION_STATUS:
     *              The plug-in has received a 'DATA_FRAGMENT' command and the plug-in will return one of the fragmentation
     *              session statuses defined in 'frag_session_status_t', e.g.,
     *              FRAG_SESSION_NOT_ACTIVE = The session is not active, a stray data fragment may be.
     *              FRAG_SESSION_OK         = Data fragment successfully received and written to block device.

     *                                      = Non-recoverable error, plug-in couldn't write to the block device. The application
     *                                        should discard any incoming data fragments and clear up any block device and assembler
     *                                        objects.
     *              FRAG_SESSION_NO_MEMORY  = Non-recoverable error, plug-in couldn't allocate memory for the operation.
     *                                        The application should discard any incoming data fragments and clear up any block
     *                                        device and assembler objects.
     *              FRAG_SESSION_COMPLETE   = Fragmentation session is complete and application can retrieve received data from the

     *         If the response 'type' = FRAG_CMD_RESP:
     *              The plug-in has received a command other than that of 'DATA_FRAGMENT'. A response will be generated and the application

     *              which contains pointer to data buffer and size of the buffer which needs to be transported to the network.
